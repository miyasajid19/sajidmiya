                        This project is a prototype of an Instagram-like application developed using Python's Tkinter
                        module, featuring core functionalities such as user registration, login, post management, and
                        more.
                        Users can register with a unique username, secure password, and valid email address, and
                        securely
                        log in to access their accounts. The application includes a navigation bar for quick access to
                        essential features like Home, Profile, and Add Post. Users can create, update, and delete posts,
                        like and unlike posts, and comment on them. They can also view posts from specific users and
                        update
                        their account details, though email and username changes are restricted. Password recovery is
                        currently insecure, requiring only a username. Future enhancements include implementing input
                        validation, enabling comment deletion, improving the user interface, and adding stronger
                        security
                        measures. For installation, clone the repository, convert the script to an executable file using
                        PyInstaller, and follow the usage instructions to register, log in, and explore the features of
                        the

                    <div class="description">
                        The Shopping Management System is a versatile e-commerce application designed to streamline the
                        online shopping experience with its robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It
                        offers two specialized interfaces: one for vendors and one for customers. The vendor interface
                        empowers sellers to efficiently manage their inventory by adding new products, viewing existing
                        ones, updating details such as images and prices, and deleting outdated or unnecessary items. On
                        the
                        customer side, the application provides a user-friendly experience with features to search for
                        products, add items to a cart or wishlist, and manage both. Customers can view and modify their
                        cart, place orders—removing items from the cart upon purchase—and view their order history.
                        Wishlist
                        items remain until explicitly deleted, providing flexibility in managing desired products.
                        Despite
                        its functional capabilities, the system's code may appear somewhat disorganized and repetitive,
                        reflecting a focus on achieving functional results rather than optimizing code structure.

                    <div class="description">
                        The 'Parking Management System' is a sophisticated software solution designed to revolutionize
                        parking operations. Developed using Python's Tkinter library for GUI and integrated with a MySQL
                        database, this system offers a seamless and efficient way to manage parking facilities. Users
                        can
                        effortlessly book parking slots, process payments securely, and register their vehicles for an
                        enhanced parking experience. With features like advanced booking, integrated payment gateways,
                        and
                        user-friendly interfaces, the system ensures convenience and ease of use. Automatic email
                        notifications provide users with essential booking details and payment receipts, while advanced
                        security measures, including digital keys and real-time surveillance, ensure vehicle safety.
                        Built
                        with scalability in mind, the system can be customized and expanded to meet evolving client
                        needs,

                        Python
                        GUI toolkit. It facilitates user communication through features like registration, login, and
                        real-time chatting among registered users. New users can register by providing their email,
                        password, and username, with email serving as the primary identification key. Once logged in,
                        users
                        can access their contacts and engage in real-time conversations, with chat history being loaded
