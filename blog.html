                    I'm Sajid Miya, a computer science and engineering student with a passion for technology. While I
                    have a
                    decent understanding of various programming languages like C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP,
                    MySQL,
                    and Python, I still lack practical experience. I can build small-scale projects using these tools,
                    but
                    I'm not yet job-ready. Currently, I find myself frequently relying on the internet and AI tools to
                    solve
                    problems, which limits my ability to excel independently. However, I understand that mastery
                    requires
                    time investment, and I'm committed to continuous learning. I believe that with dedicated effort,
                    I'll
                    eventually achieve my goals and excel in my field.
